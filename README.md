# WP Helpers

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/cf44f671-462e-40b8-baa1-317587cdf63c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/zealous-franklin-d4fd0c/deploys)

This is a quick little Next.js project using the Netlify Starter template. Overtime, the hope is to grow this into a little developer library of helper information. 

Currently: 

1. it tells you the latest WordPress version using [the publicly provided WordPress.org API](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress.org_API)
2. provides a JSON object of every single core blocks and their properties.
