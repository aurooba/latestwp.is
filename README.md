This is a quick little Next.js project using the Netlify Starter template. All it does is check and tell you what the latest WordPress version is, using [the publicly provided WordPress.org API](https://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress.org_API). This is run through Netlify Functions, which is a way to setup serverless functions and APIs for your project.
